This is a Java Web Application project for my college web programming course, in which I worked with my partner Milan.

Summary of application:
This web page is a simulation of a hotel booking website. A user logs into their account to see available hotels/rooms and has the option to book them. The application utilized database connectivity to retrieve and update info regarding hotel room availability, customer ID, etc. We ran our own servers using Microsoft SQL Server.

Please note that the database for this web page no longer exists so there is no functionality to it. This is purely for showing how I code in a team environment.

Web application was built using Eclipse for Java EE Developers.
